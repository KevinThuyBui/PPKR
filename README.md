# PPKR

This is a ride sharing and parking app for Android devices made for our senior project at CSULB. We aim to solve the congestion associated with finding parking in a full parking lot. Normally this would require driving around the parking lot until randomly finding a parking spot or by giving a ride to someone's parking spot. We aim to facilitate this transaction by connecting CSULB students to each other when you need a parking spot and eventually connecting two students with complementary arrival and departure times.
